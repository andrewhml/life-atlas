# üíª MacBook Pro (Personal) ‚Äî Device Schema

This document defines the folder structure, local vs. NAS-based storage strategy, media handling, and environment setup for my **personal MacBook Pro** under the `life-atlas` system.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Folder Layout (Rooted at `~/`)

```
~/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Applications/             # App-specific config/data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Desktop/                  # Ephemeral, cleared weekly
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Documents/                # Default macOS folder (mostly unused)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Downloads/                # Inbound items only, triaged regularly
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Workspace/                # üî® Active projects (personal, work, consulting, academic)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LiveDocs/                 # üß© Frequently accessed important documents
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Media/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Photos/               # DSLR + drone imports (see below)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ System/                   # ‚öôÔ∏è Dotfiles, scripts, preferences
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Vault/ ‚Üí /Volumes/Vault/  # ‚ùÑÔ∏è NAS-mirrored long-term archive (cold storage)
```

## üî• LiveDocs

`~/LiveDocs/` is for **time-sensitive or frequently used documents** ‚Äî it's backed up and kept minimal.

```
LiveDocs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Identity/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Health/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Finance/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025 Taxes/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Statements/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Government/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Legal/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Active Docs/         # Temporary or recent material
```

> Documents here are archived to the NAS (`Vault/DocsArchive/`) when no longer in frequent use.

---

## üñºÔ∏è Media (Photo & Video Ingest)

Only **photography and drone footage** are kept locally. All other media (TV, music, etc.) lives on the NAS.

```
Media/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Photos/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025 Photos/              # Template for each year
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DNG/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ JPG/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ RAW/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Video/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2024 Photos/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Lightroom Library/        # .lrcat and previews
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Apple Photos Library/     # macOS library bundle
```

> Year folders can be duplicated as templates. External drives or NAS are used for long-term archival.
